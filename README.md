Hi there! 👋
I'm **not a programmer**, but a passionate technical artist with **deep experience in [<ins>**Blender**</ins>](https://www.blender.org/)** — using it since version **2.79**. 
Lately, I’ve also been diving into **[<ins>Autodesk Maya</ins>](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)**, learning its standards and pipeline practices to **<ins>enhance Blender</ins>** by borrowing industry workflows, hotkeys, UX ideas, and pipeline logic.

I focus on **usability**, building **`Blender add-ons`**, and designing **tools and intuitive UI** that <ins>improve everyday workflow.</ins>

All the repositories here are `personal tools` and `experiments`, shared fully and freely with open source under Python.

## My Addons

### 🤝 Open to Requests
If you have ideas to improve Blender or want features in my `addons` — send them in! I’m always looking to **practice Python**. I **gladly accept free requests** to:
- Improving my existing addons
- Adding new features 
- General Blender UX enhancements
